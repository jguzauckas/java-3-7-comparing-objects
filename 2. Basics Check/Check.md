# Basics Check

Create three `Person` objects and assign them to variables. Give them your information, your information with a nickname, and a friends information.

Compare them and state whether or not they are the same person according to the class's `equals` method.

A sample output is as follows:

```
Mr. G and John Guzauckas are not the same person.
Mr. G and Ms. Kirchmeier are not the same person.
John Guzauckas and Ms. Kirchmeier are not the same person.
```
